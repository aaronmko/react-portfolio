        My name is Aaron Ko and I am a cohort of the April 2023 UCLA Coding Bootcamp. I received my Bachelors in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin.
        I am currently working for a Swiss-based company working as a Field Chemist.
        I am wanting to become a Full Stack Developer for a large Technology Company.           I am excited to work on various projects to develop applications that have a dynamic range of UI/UX elements.
